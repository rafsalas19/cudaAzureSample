Conduction: (meters)

Heat transferred by the process of conduction can be expressed by the following equation,

Q=(kA(THot−TCold))/d

Q = Heat transferred

K = Thermal conductivity

THOT = Hot temperature

TCOLD = Cold Temperature

t = Time

A = Area of the surface

d = Thickness of the material



change in temperature
Change in temperature = 4200 J ÷ (4.2 J/g °C × 100 g) = 10 °C
